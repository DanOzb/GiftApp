# Notes for self

## Needed:
* Add exoplayer to view videos in the gift screen 
* Add thumbnails to view in the videos gallery 
* Setup firebase 
* Add data/remote package for firebase api calls
* Test & polish


## How it should work 

* First time opening gift -> Exoplayer caches it -> We download to db
* Gifts disappear in 10 days from the app, user has to favorite it to make it stay on app
* Deleted gifts stay on cloud, just in case
